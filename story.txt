Looking over his shoulder at his newly-bought 7-story yacht, John exclaimed in anger as he realized it was the wrong color. Being a rich and handsome billionaire came with its own set of problems,
 and today's inconvenience was just the tip of the iceberg.
Despite having countless amounts of wealth at his disposal, he felt marginalized by society because of his playboy status - not only was he the target of many mean-spirited comments on social media,
 the very congressmen he'd bribed to lower the income tax on the wealthy had approved a tax increase for the weathiest 1% of society. In John's eyes, the rich have been discriminated against and
 mistreated by society. 
John doesn't like being marginlized by the society, but he can't choose what the society will be. If John could choose, he would like to be a normal person, instead feeling the endless lonely.
John was upset that his life was just oh so hard, so he had his chauffeur drive him in his Rolls Royce Ghost to the airport, where he went aboard his Boeing 787 dreamliner and asked the pilots to fly him to a country with lower taxes just to see what it was like.
